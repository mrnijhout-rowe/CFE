        "\n",
        "##Learning Objectives\n",
        "- Implement and manipulate 2D lists\n",
        "- Create functions that process 2D data structures\n",
        "- Design user interaction for a text-based application\n",
        "- Develop winning condition algorithms\n",
        "- Practice collaborative coding techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "##Basic Requirements\n",
        "- Create a standard Connect Four board (7 columns Ã— 6 rows)\n",
        "- Display the board in the terminal after each move\n",
        "- Allow two players to take turns placing pieces\n",
        "- Validate moves (check if the selected column is full)\n",
        "- Detect when a player wins\n",
        "- End the game appropriately when there's a winner\n"
